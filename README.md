This directory is a learning sandbox for neural networks 
driven by caffe either through Jupyter notebooks or c++
Using MNIST data, I seek to practice implementation of 
both shallow and deep nets through the above toolset.

MNIST data, both training and validation, is ported through
LMDB via the scripts located in the data/ directory. These
scripts are meant to be run from their home directory as 
paths are hardcoded in.
